  abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of
	human genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating
	the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here we present
	results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and
	compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput
	platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome
	sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage
	sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing
	of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location,
	allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15
	million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions
	and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were
	previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued
	the vast majority of common variation, over 95\% of the currently
	accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data
	set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250
	to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100
	variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate
	how these results can be used to inform association and functional
	studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de
	novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8)
	per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to
	signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction
	of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection
	at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next
	phase of human genetic research.},

  journal = {Ann Hum Genet},

  month = {Oct},
  abstract = {Interaction between genetic variants is hypothesized to be one of
	several putative explanations for the 'case of missing heritability.'
	Therefore, Genome-Wide Interaction Analysis (GWIA) has recently gained
	substantial interest. GWIA is computationally challenging and respective
	power type I error studies are particularly difficult. Therefore,
	an accepted significance level for GWIA studies does not currently
	exist. It has been shown that for a GWAS single-marker analysis with
	n SNPs a correction for multiple testing with 1/2 ·n is appropriate
	for populations of European ancestry. We speculated that for GWIA,
	correction by 1/4 ·m should be appropriate, where m=n· (n- 1)/2 is
	the number of SNP pairs. We tried to verify this hypothesis using
	the INTERSNP program that implements interaction analysis and genome-wide
	Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. Using a type I error study based on
	Illumina(®) HumanHap 550 data, we were able to reproduce the published
	result for single-marker analysis. For GWIA using a test for allelic
	interaction, we show that correction with roughly 0.4 ·m is appropriate,
	a number that is somewhat larger than that of our hypothesis. In
	summary, it can be stated that for an Illumina(®) -type marker panel
	with 500,000 SNPs, an uncorrected P-value of 1.0 × 10(-12) is needed
	to establish genome-wide significance at the 0.05 level.},

	typical of that occurring in randomized controlled trials in pain,
	that the most commonly used statistics do not give the expected levels
	of statistical significance (i.e. the proportion of trials giving
	a significant result is not equal to the proportion expected due
	to random chance) when used with truly homogeneous data. In addition,
	all such statistics are shown to have extremely low power to detect
	true heterogeneity even when that heterogeneity is very large. Since,
	in most practical situations, failure to detect heterogeneity does
	not allow us to say with any helpful degree of certainty that the
	data is truly homogeneous, we advocate the quantitative combination
	of results only where the trials contained in a meta-analysis can
	be shown to be clinically homogeneous. We propose as a definition
	of clinical homogeneity that all trials have (i) fixed and clearly
	defined inclusion criteria and (ii) fixed and clearly defined outcomes

	would be satisfied by all patients having moderate or severe pain,

  abstract = {SUMMARY: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have lead to the identification
	of hundreds of genomic regions associated with complex diseases.
	Nevertheless, a large fraction of their heritability remains unexplained.
	Interaction between genetic variants is one of several putative explanations
	for the 'case of missing heritability' and, therefore, a compelling
	next analysis step. However, genome-wide interaction analysis (GWIA)
	of all pairs of SNPs from a standard marker panel is computationally
	unfeasible without massive parallelization. Furthermore, GWIA of
	all SNP triples is utopian. In order to overcome these computational
	constraints, we present a GWIA approach that selects combinations
	of SNPs for interaction analysis based on a priori information. Sources
	of information are statistical evidence (single marker association
	at a moderate level), genetic relevance (genomic location) and biologic
	relevance (SNP function class and pathway information). We introduce
	the software package INTERSNP that implements a logistic regression
	framework as well as log-linear models for joint analysis of multiple
	SNPs. Automatic handling of SNP annotation and pathways from the
	KEGG database is provided. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations to
	judge genome-wide significance are implemented. We introduce various
	meaningful GWIA strategies that can be conducted using INTERSNP.
	Typical examples are, for instance, the analysis of all pairs of
	non-synonymous SNPs, or, the analysis of all combinations of three
	SNPs that lie in a common pathway and that are among the top 50,000
	single-marker results. We demonstrate the feasibility of these and
	other GWIA strategies by application to a GWAS dataset and discuss
	promising results. AVAILABILITY: The software is available at http://intersnp.meb.uni-bonn.de

	efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome
	data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK
	and describe the five main domains of function: data management,
	summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis,
	and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the
	estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information
	in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information
	can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and
	to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical
	by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of
