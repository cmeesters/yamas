\chapter{Introduction}

Welcome to \textsc{yamas} (\textcolor{pdarkblue}{\bf Y}et \textcolor{pdarkblue}{A}nother \textcolor{pdarkblue}{M}eta-\textcolor{pdarkblue}{A}nalysis \textcolor{pdarkblue}{S}oftware)!\newline

\textsc{yamas} tries to fulfill various meta-analysis needs with regard to genome-wide association studies. There are other softwares around, but we hope with \textsc{yamas} more features are provided and more possible pitfalls avoided.\newline

This manual should provide you with a comprehensive overview of the software. Still, if after referring to this manual a nagging question is left (or, if you discover a bug), you are most welcome to write us \Email{Tim.Becker@dzne.de} and \Email{meesters@uni-mainz.de}\footnote{I left the institute shortly after writing the software and am now to find at the \textsc{zdv}, University of Mainz, Germany (see \url{http://zdv.uni-mainz.de}).}(please put both emails in the address field of your mail client) in case of any nagging question.\newline

Note that you can \textcolor{pdarkblue}{\bf click on every link to jump within this manual}.\newline

In order to get started we recommend reading at least the following chapter. For the rest skip whatever you like, but be aware that you might miss essential information which you need to exploit the full power of \textsc{yamas}.\newline

\textbf{\Huge Enjoy!}
